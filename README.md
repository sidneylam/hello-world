# hello-world
new hand practices

It has been about 3 years since the last time I visited GitHub. I had little coding experience 3 years ago. But now, I am embracing the world of information technology.

Programming might not be able to bring me as much money as we need. But it expands the world of our life. We can build things in a little computer. Amazing, isn't it?

Thank you, my reader. Thank you, my friends who had shared me a lot of programing knowledge in the last few years. 

Thank you, my family. And at last, thank you, to myself. You've tried quite hard to get through these years.

Things will get better, as the foundation has been setup. 

Let's create the grand new future. Happy every day!
